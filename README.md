## Overview

This framework integrates quantum mechanics principles with modern problem-solving methodologies. It provides a structured approach to generating creative solutions across various domains through parallel thinking and probabilistic analysis.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Reality Recognition**: Simultaneous consideration of possibilities
- **Creative Synthesis**: Cross-domain knowledge integration
- **Metacognitive Dynamics**: Self-evolving thought processes
- **Quantum Narrative**: Multi-perspective solution generation
- **Adaptive Feedback**: Context-sensitive response systems

## Core Principles

The framework is built on five fundamental concepts:

1. **Quantum Superposition**: Consider multiple solutions simultaneously
2. **Entanglement**: Connect ideas across different domains
3. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Balance creative and practical aspects
4. **Quantum Tunneling**: Break through conventional barriers
5. **Observer Effect**: Integrate feedback and adaptation
